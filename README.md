## About the Project

  Hello, we are the Codesman! Thank you for your interest in our app, we hope you find it useful!

  Cede is an application created to allow users to have a standardized end-point for their information. When the user creates an account and saves their information, the application will create a QR code for the user. This QR code will serve as an end-point for Medical facilities as well as Paramedics to access critical information expediting the patient's care with full access to it's medical history.
