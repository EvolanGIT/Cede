## Description
Cede is an application created to allow users to have a standardized end-point for their information.
When the user creates an account and saves their information, the application will create a QR code for the user. This QR code will serve as an end-point for Medical facilities as well as Paramedics to access critical information expediting the patient's care with full access to it's medical history. 

## Usage
Sign up as a patient or provider. A patient can fill out a form was the most need information an emergency room or paramedic will need and saved to their profile. A provider will need to request access, with a proof of business, example a hospital will need to provide medical license number.

## Requirements
New users will have to sign up for an account.
