# Cede
Cede is an application created to allow users to have a standardized end-point for their information.
When the user creates an account and saves their information, the application will create a QR code for the user. This QR code will serve as an end-point for Medical facilities as well as Paramedics to access critical information expediting the patient's care with full access to it's medical history.
